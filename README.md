# YOLOv8 Object Detection on Aquarium Dataset  

## ADSP 32023 IP01 (Spring 2025) - Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning  

This repository contains my notes and **Google Colab notebook** from the *Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning* course at the **University of Chicago (Spring 2025)**.  
I served as a **Teaching Assistant (TA)** for this course.  

The notebook demonstrates how to train and test a **YOLOv8 object detection model** on the **Aquarium Dataset**, which includes images of different types of fish and marine animals.  
The dataset was prepared and labeled using **Roboflow**, making it easy to integrate with YOLOv8 for object detection tasks.

**How to Use :**

Open and run the notebook in Google Colab here:
